I received a reply from Airside Mobile stating that there is no PII sent to Airside servers and that all PII is only stored on the device.  This can't possibly be true since they define PII as ""name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, passport number, date and place of birth, credit card number.""  Clearly, they manage at least my name and email since one of their uses of PII is to send ""important notices,"" from which I can't opt-out.

don't like it. It WAS super easy, convenient, no frills, no charges, no

seems I HAVE to use to transfer anything which also takes more steps with 
less confirmation. Maybe I'm missing something in the super-minimal

562,"1. Following the 2020-11-27 update, the opening screen showed a commercial advertisement (Amazon Prime film on dogs with a clear button to download the Amazon Prime app). The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äòconsole‚Äô (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äôs orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Ä¶ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time. Would increase battery life and user experience (less charging).",x,N,Y,,Y,N,x,Y,Y,x,Y,N

The fact that you don't allow copy/paste or autofill is a huge joke. I use LastPass to generate and autofill a secure password for all of my accounts. By forcing users to actually type a password in, you're forcing me to use a password that's more easily rememberable and thus, unsecure.  You also have fairly strong password requirements (8 characters, upper and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols) which means you have at least one somewhat competent security expert so I'm pretty confused by your asinine decision to block pasting and autofill.",x,N,Y,,Y,N,,Y,Y,,Y,Y

638,"Incredible how easy this app is to use and how quickly it breezes you through customs.  We literally walked off the plane, passed the lines of people waiting at the kiosks, entered a line dedicated to mobile passports, and waited 10 seconds while the customs guard finished the guy in front of us.  We waited maybe 10 minutes for our luggage to arrive, and were walking out before the rest of our plane was through customs.    A lot of people have expressed concerns about sharing passport information with a third party.  I get those concerns, but the app is approved by the CBP, and I'm sure they are very strict about how personal data can be used.  I could see there being extra security done behind the scenes - I wouldn't recommend using this if you're a known terrorist, for example - but even the in-app ""purchases"" are unintrusively listed at the end of your submission, or can be accessed through a separate 'services' menu (passport renewal and TSA pre-check applications are the only two I've seen).
