12,"I do not have this App on my device but have been charged AUD $29.99. I am extremely frustrated and will pursue consumer law pathways if my money is not refunded. After signing up for a ""FREE TRIAL"", I used the app to photograph a tree I know to be a sallow, ie. salix. The app identified it as an apple, which is absurd enough but in addition to that it also gave me a heap of stupid hippie info. That was enough for me to realise the app was not suitable for my needs, and I delete it immediately. Nonetheless, a week later, Google charged me AUD29.99 for this App which I neither have nor want. GLORITY, I would appreciate if you would contact me about this.  #Angry #Frustrated #ConsumerLaw",N,N

21,"I would highly recommend this software for virus protection, except the creators of bitdefender are not smart enough to let you do a master reset on your phone and still have your software after you download it from the Google Play Store again. This is the second time in several years where I needed to do the install again, and their software refuses to recognize my subscription from my central account information. Sadly, bitdefender also has this same problem on normal PC's. I am tired of calling them, or emailing them (and waiting a month for a reply) to get their software running properly again when there should have been an activation code that I should have seen from my central account so I could reapply it on my phone app. Since they've had the same problem for multiple years now,... I would not recommend this software for anyone. There are many other virus protection software that do the job correctly.",N,N

24,I've loved instacart for years. It frustrating when I'm trying to scroll through my cart and I accidently hit the remove button. May I suggest either making a settings option to confirm a removed item before it's just deleted. Because sometimes you can't remember what the deleted item was. Also can you restore the option to request an item not listed. LASTLY BRING BACK GROUP CARTS. Family cart worthless only 1 person can be added. Why the limit? Group carts wasn't broke why try to fix it?,N,N
25,"BEWARE!!Worst app, totally sucks that so many other company's are partnered with instacart, they hold your money, cancel your order after its already been paid, there's no support. They locked my account twice for using the same card I had been on the app for weeks and when I sent my ID and credit card as proof of identity, they emailed me back from a different email address saying my account is closed & not to use their service anymore.

249,"It's not bad really but some improvements would serve it well.  My TL;DR assessment... a solid neutral... has good features that could be improved upon.  I do like that you can pre-order items BEFORE you head to the store, and THEN press the button to actually ""prepare order"" when you're nearing the store. This means that your order doesn't get made long before you head there, OR that you have to be ACTIVELY placing the order when you're near the store. At a few traffic lights near the store I press send, get to the store just as my order is finishing up, grab it and go ... easy peasy. But with this comes a downside. [BTW... Starbucks app doesn't have this function, and from experience, if I ""preorder"" items by placing into my shopping basket (with intention to hit ""send"" when I'm near the store) I usually find that the app has cleared and deleted my order. This means I'm trying to re-add my orders before the traffic light turns green, or do it in the parking lot when I arrive. Defeats the ""convenience"" and time saving factor]  So here's 2 things that could be improved upon. Receipt should appear on the app history immediately after sending-order-to-prepare (like Starbucks app). I've so far had 2 incidences where I've arrived at the store to have them blankly look at me. The order didn't get to the store. First time it happened I assumed I made a mistake and didn't send the order correctly. Since I was rushing to get to work-- I left, but the next day saw my card had been charged. If i could've simply pulled up my receipt on the app and shown it to the staff, they could've made it real quick. Second time this happend I thought I may have sent it to the wrong store (I frequent 2 stores regularly, one when I head to work, the other for the gym)... if only I could've pulled up a receipt to checkü§î...  In either case I couldn't be bothered to call customer service, and justified it by taking into account all the ""rewards"" drinks I've received over time.   ***To be fair both incidences occurred at one store, so it may be a system issue only on part of this particular location. I will now only send my online order when I'm physically in this store (so I can hear the bell ring that signals they received the order). Also, it has only happened twice in all the many times I've ordered using the app.  Lastly, if the store is out of something (or in my case, espresso machine is broken) the store cannot refund the app directly... Like Starbucks app does. Luckily for me this happened to me at the good location where the guy remembers my name. He just remembered to IOU me the next time... So yea... the lesson here is ALWAYS tip your server/barista/donut-slinger.  *** Again, to be fair this happened a while ago and I don't know if this has been patched/updated for Dunkin Donuts to be able to do so.",N,N

258,"I swear if something else happens and I have to start all over again..ill give up, I had the perfect review...both with my personal opinion of the positive and negative factors to this texting APP!   POSITIVE: You can change and customize every texting feature possible!! You can choose from already made themes to ""diy"" all the way to the fonts, colors, text bubbles, backgrounds and even keyboard + some! Gave 5 üåü when I seen all the different free, no rooting customizations available for 0.00 dollars!   I've been using Mood for a little over 2 months now and I've noticed some negatives things, but honestly...if something is FREE, there is no room for any downfalls...   NEGATIVE: Its been lagging a bit, takes awhile to actually pop up and the whole reason of texting is the quickness and quick replies, right? It says in the title text and MMS, I can not get my inbox pic/video texts to ever download alway replies ""download failed, try again"" I've tried for a straight 10 years to change, look through the settings..I want to know what my loved ones are sending me vice versa..when I try and send a MMS message, I get ""Text/mms not delievered, and another try again!!!??   Any proffessional help from y'all mood, to help my ""mood when texting""  Also, not be a downer, I'll admit I'm like 80% OCD on particular things, such as a semi clean home and a nice detailed inside of my car but I'm most OCD over my phone, I love when its perfect and set up the right way. My phone is apart of me and it reflects on it too! "" A few nicks and scratches on the outside cover but inside close to near mint condition! Well organized, colorful and also fun"" but having two duplicate acting apps just for texting bothers me more than it should, this is the only phone ive had where I've had to download a texting app..android and Google play has always allowed me to customize my factory text app as Well as others....I can't uninstall the factory text and rooting is not worth the risk...so in my opinion if you don't have a problem with MMS and you're not OCD or you can live hiding an app...this is the best texting app I have used compared to others similar and the ones that have costed me$$. Its the best. Definitely worth the free download or to atleast try mood out! OMG...I actually finished this review without hitting; back, delete or Clear All button... Submit!!! :)  P.s #LongReview  I'm bored, can't sleep and looove typing..which brings me to another downfall..my keyboard isn't pretty unless its texting through the mood app, typing this, my keyboard is black amd grey factory style!

They limit the amount of coins you can get from big receipts to 100 ""per week"" according to them (again, it's 10 days)... This is technically fraud being as they straight up lie to you, making you wait longer for ""weekly"" bonuses and therefore stealing your valuable time. I would've left it at 5 had they not falsely advertised their product.  I don't rate it 1 star because anyone can still get some value from this app, albeit not what they advertise. But c'mon Receipt Hog, why did you have to go and join the already countless companies who make profits from LIES? How hard is it to not falsely advertise? Was there any NEED to do this?  *** ORIGINAL REVIEW *** Brutally cool and worthwhile. It starts off very slow BUT the key to getting the most out of it is being PERSISTENT. Once you've made to level 33 (current highest level) you'll literally be making near $2.50 EVERY WEEK just for staying active with at least one receipt upload per week. That's $2.50 you didn't have, and all for uploading a few receipts. Not to mention the hundreds of sweepstakes entries you will have made by then if you're a regular user, which is cool because you never know when you might hit that huge jackpot.   I trust the company is legit, but I only hope they don't find some random reason to kick me out once I've attained a high level. It HAS happened that they've cut thousands of users off with a few day's notice because of lack of funds. I only hope this was true and not a way to just get more newbies just so they wouldn't spend that much money on weekly bonuses... I guess time will tell but I'm a pretty active reviewer throughout the net, so whether this turns out great as it seems so far or whether they use me and spit me back out when it's more convenient for them, people WILL know.

I asked for my friend's phone and we tried to call him straight away. The phone was unavailable for calls and messages. I turned on the function ""Find my Samsung"" to track the way my phone was going, and I could see it was still working. So, I wrote a message on the screen from the App ""Find my Samsung"" saying ""Hello, could you arrange to give my phone back, pls call me"" Then my partner's numbers was straight on the screen. I never got any messages or calls... NOTHING! My friend and I tried to get in touch with the email that Didi provide, no helpful emails back at all. All they could say was sorry... bla bla... So, I made my way to the police station, and we tried to call him in another phone number that only the Police has access. So, just and only in that way , after 3 days trying to get my phone back I could have it. But this all thank the Police, not Didi's Service. RUBISH SERVICE!

370,"PLEASE READ THIS WARNING: This is going to be a long review, but I must get this out there. I've been a loyal reader of Lezhin and I have bought chapters to tons of comics, including Something About Us, Killing Stalking, and many others. I know the coin system is very expensive, as many others have complained about, but I was told that the company supposedly takes very good care of their artists, which made me continue to use their coin system. However, recently, I just can't stand how unreasonable Lezhin is being about one of their recent events, the Coin Back event. At first, the event was very exciting, because they claimed that all the coins you spend on the mentioned comics would be refunded at a later time. Since multiple comics I wanted to read were on there, I went ahead and bought a large package of coins, expecting to get it all back. I figured that I should wait until the coins refunded before reading other comics, because I have limited funds for this hobby of mine. Nearly a month past since this happened, and I open up the app again only to still see a balance of 0 coins. I asked the company about this through customer service and they claimed it was my own fault for not logging on during this short period of time to claim my refunded coins, and now they have all expired, leaving me with absolutely nothing to claim. This is beyond disappointing, and is honestly utterly infuriating. Why would the rewards for such an event expire if it weren't for the company obviously trying to scam customers, hoping that they missed the fine print detailing the expiration of the rewards like I did? There is no logical reason for such a policy save for Lezhin's own selfish, money-making desires. The coins already are priced beyond reason, but this really was the final straw. Lezhin supposedly takes care of artists, but they definitely treat their customers poorly, as I have unfortunately experienced. As an avid reader of comics, I implore you all to be wary of Lezhin and their shameless money scams. I know the comics are good, but this is unacceptable treatment towards paying customers. I feel so cheated. Also, a note to artists: I respect you guys very much, but if you care about your readers, please reconsider using Lezhin comics to publish your work. Thank you.",N,N

It is sometimes euphemistically referred as a ""protection  racket"" since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for  ""protection"" from real or hypothetical threats from unspecified other  parties; though often, and almost always. the person or organization  offering ""protection"" is the same willing to cause harm if the money is not  paid, and such it is implied in the rent of protection offer. The actual  obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Just  ""Google extortion"" and make your own assumption. e.g. Yelp will push  legitimate reviews of your business to their not recommended section  unless, advertiser (user, business owner) is willing to paid for their  advertising services or they will push negative reviews of your business to  the top unless again you pay for their advertising services and incur into  at least $300/month expense. Also Yelp has a double moral they claim their  platform provides legitimate reviews from users, yet they do not confirm if  users are actual real people. Anyone can create a fake email nowadays and  just go about and post a review which brings a negative impact to business  owners. I would say stay away from Yelp!!!",N,N

I agree with the vast majority of posts about this horrible app.  You apparently can only use this with your cellphone (could not register with my tablet); and you HAVE to give access to your photos and phone numbers.  I do not have an account with the few crooked big banks (banks that I have always tried to avoid doing business with) that seem to be pushing this garbage app, but Zelle claims that I can access funds sent to me by registering my debit card.  That did not work either.  So, in the meantime, Zelle gets to keep the money intended for me.",N,N

A 2-for-5 special turned into a $16+ order. this time I was on top of it. I told the lady at the drive through not to make the order and that I just wanted the 2 sandwiches. She agreed and I just received my two sandwiches. I told her that I would contact Jack and get it resolved. No telephone numbers for Jack worded and there does not appear to be a methodology to contact Jack bu phone. Email is a bear when mobile as they ask lots of receipt details. I called the store. After three attempts, I got through to manager (I think name was Brigetta at the Leander Road, Georgetown Texas location). She was adamant that they do not deal with mobile order problems and the I must contact corporate mobile support. I explained that I have been trying. She was insistent to put it kindly. Seems like an offer of 2 or 3 combos would have made this issue closed and keep me as a customer (I do stop there at least 23x per week for myself and work).

As far as I could tell, there was no way to turn this off in settings, and while it is relatively small, this process was using ~30mb and slowly draining battery by using location features.

Folks, when are the NFL and the Owners finally going to put a mandatory mentoring program in place to help these immature 20's yr old, that are making $$$$Millions of dollars to help them with discipline, financial advice and how to transform young millionaires into a real hero. Why was Hunt even put in the situation where this event took place. The Cleveland police didnt arrest anyone involved by just sweeping it under rug. They had access to surveillance footage and decided to do nothing. It doesn't matter who hit who first....Men brought up in a two parent home(which is rarely the case anymore.) Hunt should have and most likely was taught; That no matter if any young girl/woman hits you, slaps you... You never hit a woman period!!! let alone punching her in the Face, which is wrong on all levels.

Nothing wrong with updating apps BUT IT SEEMS YOU DON'T TAKE THE   COMMENTS OF THE USERS SERIOUSLY. I picked all teams in NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL.

My opinion keep the original version  for now. Also have The Score app for one sole reason. It gives game attendance in case those that are interested. Yahoo Sports doesn't offer that. They should.

IF SO IM NEVER GONNA GET 1,000GEMS SO ILL DELETE IT!",N,N
657,"IT WAS A GREAT GAME BUT NOW IT WANTS YOU TO BUY. SINCE I UNINSTALLED NOW IT TROLLS MY FEEDS TO GET ME BACK .NOT VERY COOL FROM MY STANDPOINT .VERY CREEPY TO SAY THE LEAST NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. ALSO ARE PEOPLE WINNING MONEY? Sounds like some comments are insinuating so,well my version doesn't say that's even an option so what's the deal? I want to win real money too.",N,N
658,"I have time to play maybe once a day. I've hopped on, used all my rolls, then had nearly EVERY SINGLE COIN STOLEN right before I used them TWO DAYS IN A ROW NOW.  This game is trash and I'm literally wasting my time playing just to give it ALL to someone who doesn't even need it. DONT BOTHER.. Why would you even ALLOW people to steal that much from new players?You really think I'm gonna wait and come back after that nonsense? Like seriously how many people like myself lose 90% of their coins on their first few tries and just QUIT. I gave you a second chance, you won't get a third.",N,N
659,Absolutely Ridiculous. some random girl stole 1.5 MILLION from me!!! I worked so hard to accumulate that and was left with nearly nothing. I have NEVER had the opportunity to steal that much from anyone EVER. There needs to be a max on how much can be stolen because that's UNFAIR and annoying. DELETING THE APP !,N,N
660,"1. Following the 2020-11-27 update, the opening screen showed a commercial advertisement (Amazon Prime film on dogs with a clear button to download the Amazon Prime app). The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was actively - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time. Would increase battery life and user experience (less charging).",Y,Y

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy.

Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6.

Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not not via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation.

The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available fromthe a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6.

Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. tthe Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually using the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation.

The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation.

The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - your cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6.

I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate this map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6.

I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.

The update release notes innocently mentioned minor improvements but nothing about the added ads, and the app description did not show any 'Containing Ads' sign. I was a paying customer - USD 200/year for two dogs + USD 100 for two trackers. Reported the app to Google, removed it from my phone, returned the trackers and canceled my subscription - no refund what so ever. 2. The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation.

The connection (and business model?) is cloud-based over cellular (LTE), which is OK and even fine - but a built-in Bluetooth transceiver which cannot be switched off (always on and visible) should be explained. Why is it required? If everything is done via Tractive servers - then everything should be done via Tractive servers. I assume that it adds wattage to the device power envelope and drains the battery faster. There are also security and privacy concerns with BT always on (but Tractive and privacy seem to be quiet apart ;)) 3. Paying users should also take advantage of the cloud-based connection and see more data - in real time and as history. Users must be in control of that data. Data may include technical aspects such as connection quality (over time and location), FW log and revision, etc. NOT only statistics on how much the dog was active - it is a technical device, not a toy. For USD 100/year/dog the user should have much more insight and control via the web-based ‚Äö√Ñ√≤console‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (not necessarily via the mobile app). 4.The USB cable should be used for debug and local operations, on top of charging (i.e. - data, not only power), when connected to a PC (and possibly to a phone). Also, the socket end of the cable should be USB-C, so charging could be made available from a phone too. 5. The Leaderboard and activity visualisation is embarrassing, useless (at least for me) and you cannot switch it off. So it, yet again, pops-up when you need to actually use the app and track your dogs - asking you to set an activity goal. Until you have surrendered and set that activity goal for your dog - you cannot continue using the app :) 6. At least when in Live mode - the app should be able to rotate the map according to the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orientation. What it does instead (not very reliably) is to display a small arrow which is intended at pointing in the tracker direction‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ 7. A more advanced feature would be a mode in which cellular is switched on only when there's a (configurable) location difference over a (configurable) period of time.
